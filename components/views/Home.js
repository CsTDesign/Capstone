      As somebody who meal preps to follow a fitness journey to build muscle,
      meal prepping was sometimes challenging for a number of reasons. From
      shortness of time to complexity of the recipe, I can relate. Whether the
      reason was because of the recipe's complexity, or simply lack of time, I
      sought to make a change to how I approached meal prepping.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could tell my phone what I had available in my fridge, freezer, and
      pantry, what if it gave me suggestions on what to make? Thus became the
      genesis of iMealPrep.
