    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Cory Taylor - Not to be confused with the front man for the band
      Slipknot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in St. Louis, and I am proud to call it home. My
      in-laws were the biggest help to encourage me to take the Full Stack Web
      Development cohort through Savvy Coders. While I have dabbled in HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript before, this cohort not only helped me learn new ideas
      but also helped me to pursue a career within this field.
    </p>
