        <p>As somebody who meal preps to follow a fitness journey to build muscle, meal prepping was sometimes challenging for a number of reasons. From shortness of time to complexity of the recipe, I can relate. Whether the reason was because of the recipe's complexity, or simply lack of time, I sought to make a change to how I approached meal prepping.</p>
        <p>If I could tell my phone what I had available in my fridge, freezer, and pantry, what if it gave me suggestions on what to make? Thus became the genesis of iMealPrep.</p>
