##Definition Statement
- I want to build the app iMealPrep to help make meal prep easier without the constant grocery store trips for ingredients. Using your phone or tablet's camera, you can shoot pictures of foods in your fridge, freezer, or pantry, then let iMealPrep give you recipe suggestions based on the pictures you have taken.

##Target Audience
- iMealPrep is perfect for anybody who enjoys cooking, whether you are a personal trainer, love to stick to a meal prep routine, or looking to improve your health and fitness.
